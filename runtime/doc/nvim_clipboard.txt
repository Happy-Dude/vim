Clipboard integration for Nvim			       *nvim-clipboard*

Nvim has no connection to the system clipboard, instead it is accessible
through the |nvim-provider| infrastructure which transparently uses shell
commands for communicating with the clipboard.

To use clipboard on Nvim, make sure you have one of the following programs
installed and available on $PATH:

- xclip
- xsel(newer alternative to xclip)
- pbcopy/pbpaste(already available on Mac OS X)

Having any of these programs should enable the '+' and '*' registers. As an
optional step, set the 'unnamedclip' option to transparently access clipboard
using the unnamed register. If you use the same |vimrc| for both Vim and Nvim,
make sure you only set the option when `has('nvim')` is true:
>
    if has('nvim')
      set unnamedclip
    endif
